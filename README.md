## üßæ Turbonomic Action Group Routing Service
### üìå Overview

This Flask-based application provides a serverless integration layer between **Turbonomic** and **ServiceNow**, hosted on **IBM Cloud Code Engine**. It ensures that only **approved actions** are sent to ServiceNow by programmatically managing Turbonomic group memberships.

It supports two key functions:

* Moving entities from a *pre-approved* group to an *approved* group (once a user approves the action).
* Restoring entities back to the *pre-approved* group (typically after an action has executed).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* ‚úÖ Secure login to the Turbonomic API
* ‚úÖ Group membership management via REST APIs
* ‚úÖ Lightweight Flask app deployable to serverless platforms like Code Engine
* ‚úÖ Logging and error handling for maintainability
* ‚úÖ JSON-based webhook support

}
```

#### `POST /restore_entity_group`

### üèóÔ∏è Deployment Notes

This app is designed to run as a containerized workload, ideally in a serverless environment like **IBM Cloud Code Engine**. You can build and deploy it using Docker or Podman and bind the environment variables via a `.env` file or service bindings.

**To run locally:**

```bash
export TURBOHOST=https://<your-turbo-url>
export TURBOUSER=<your-user>
export TURBOPASS=<your-pass>
export PRE_APPROVED_GROUP_ID=<uuid>
export APPROVED_GROUP_ID=<uuid>

python app.py
```

---

### üìÑ Example Use Case

This service is typically invoked by a Turbonomic workflow **after an action is manually approved**, allowing an automation pipeline to:

* Maintain human oversight
* Filter low-value actions
* Improve compliance and change control by only forwarding approved actions to downstream systems like **ServiceNow**.
